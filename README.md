# Code Implementation `Junior`
> For this exercice, you're required  to use puppeteer for at least one of the bots.

You have "carte blanche" for the extracted data, we'll let you appreciate what's relevant from what's not.

## Pages Jaunes Scraper
 - [ ] Implement a bot that extract a Pages Jaunes's profile like this [URL](https://www.pagesjaunes.fr/siret/87840067000013)

## Slack Members Scraper
> Hint: this one might be a little bit tricky, you'll probably have to inject cookies with Puppeteer.

 - [ ] Implement a bot that extract members of Slack's channel

# Code Implementation `Intermediate`
`Don't do this section unless we've asked you to.`

## API Implementation
### Explain the concept of middlewares in Express?
> Your answer

### API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement a class that represents the object User with 3 fields of your choosing
- [ ] Implement an endpoint to get a fake user, using the class
- [ ] Implement an endpoint to create a (fake) user, using the class
- [ ] Implement an endpoint to delete a user by id
- [ ] Implement an endpoint to read a JSON and return it via the API

## Security Implementation
- [ ] Add a middleware that protects both endpoints with an API Key

### Question: which other type of security could you add?
> Your answer

## Enhancements
- [ ] Add compression to the API
- [ ] Add cors to the API
- [ ] Implementer a linter to the project

## What is CORS? Why is it required most of the time?
> Your answer
